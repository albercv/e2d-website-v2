In today's fast-paced business environment, **traditional development approaches are no longer sufficient**. Companies implementing agile methodologies report up to 40% increase in productivity and 60% faster time-to-market.

## The Challenge of Traditional Development

Most businesses still rely on waterfall methodologies that create bottlenecks:

- **Long development cycles** (6-12 months)
- **Limited flexibility** to changing requirements
- **Late feedback** from stakeholders
- **High risk** of project failure

2. **Cross-functional Teams**
   - Developers, designers, and business analysts
   - Direct communication channels
   - Shared responsibility and ownership

   - Continuous feedback loops
   - Feature prioritization based on business value
